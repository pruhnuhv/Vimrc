I've handpicked bits of the config from various various repositories, so, thanks to everyone that Open sourced their vimrcs. This is a simple stupid Vimrice catering to my fidgety brain. jk (I had to type j <space> k and delete the space because those two characters put me into Normal mode :').
Copy the init.vim file to your .config/nvim folder (for neovim users) and do a :PlugInstall. Everything should workout hopefully. I am not using YouCompleteMe anymore so I have that commented out.
