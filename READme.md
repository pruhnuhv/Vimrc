This is my vim rice made with love and taking inputs from all over the internet.
I have used the minimalist vim-plug which makes it easier to install plugins.
Also, currently my neovim is set to harcoding ie I've turned off the arrow keys to get used to the hjkl methods.
If you want the same looks & functionalities for your NeoVim just clone this repo. (.config/nvim/ on a Linux OS)
